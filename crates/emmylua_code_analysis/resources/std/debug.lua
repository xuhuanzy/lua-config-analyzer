--- Returns a table with information about a function. You can give the
--- function directly, or you can give a number as the value of `f`,
--- which means the function running at level `f` of the call stack
--- of the given thread: level 0 is the current function (`getinfo` itself);
--- level 1 is the function that called `getinfo` (except for tail calls, which
--- do not count on the stack); and so on. If `f` is a number larger than
--- the number of active functions, then `getinfo` returns **nil**.
---
--- The returned table can contain all the fields returned by `lua_getinfo`,
--- with the string `what` describing which fields to fill in. The default for
--- `what` is to get all information available, except the table of valid
--- lines. If present, the option '`f`' adds a field named `func` with the
--- function itself. If present, the option '`L`' adds a field named
--- `activelines` with the table of valid lines.
---
--- For instance, the expression `debug.getinfo(1,"n").name` returns a table
--- with a name for the current function, if a reasonable name can be found,
--- and the expression `debug.getinfo(print)` returns a table with all available
--- information about the `print` function.

---
--- This function returns the name and the value of the local variable with

--- accesses not only explicit local variables, but also parameters,

---
--- The first parameter or local variable has index 1, and so on, following the
--- order that they are declared in the code, counting only the variables that
--- are active in the current scope of the function. Negative indices refer to
--- vararg parameters; -1 is the first vararg parameter. The function returns
--- **nil** if there is no variable with the given index, and raises an error
--- when called with a level out of range. (You can call `debug.getinfo` to
--- check whether the level is valid.)
---
--- Variable names starting with '(' (open parenthesis) represent variables with
--- no known names (internal variables such as loop control variables, and
--- variables from chunks saved without debug information).

--- only the name of function parameters.

--- Sets the given function as a hook. The string `mask` and the number `count`
--- describe when the hook will be called. The string mask may have any
--- combination of the following characters, with the given meaning:
---
--- * `"c"`: the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;
--- * `"r"`: the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;
--- * `"l"`: the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.
---
--- Moreover, with a `count` different from zero, the hook is called after every
--- `count` instructions.
---
--- When called without arguments, `debug.sethook` turns off the hook.
---
--- When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string describing
--- the event that has triggered its call: `"call"`, (or `"tail
--- call"`), `"return"`, `"line"`, and `"count"`. For line events, the hook also
--- gets the new line number as its second parameter. Inside a hook, you can
